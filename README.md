# Details

This is my personal nVim config based on lua and inspired mostly by the theprimagen install

## A few considerations

* to install packer check out the official packer installation (hint, it's a git repo that needs to be cloned and installed locally
* inside the packer.lua file in lua/chip/packer.lua you do :so and after that :PackerSync to install everything
* Check out how to install packer before you :so it and :PackerSync 
* After everything is installed use :Mason to install pyright - for the LSP
